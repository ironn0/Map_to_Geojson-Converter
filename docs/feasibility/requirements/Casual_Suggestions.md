# Spontaneous User Suggestions for Map to GeoJSON Converter (Student Version)

## Introduction
Spontaneous user suggestions are ideas that come naturally from people who use or discover the tool, without direct questions. You can collect spontaneous feedback by opening discussions on GitHub or forums like Reddit, where users share opinions on what to improve. This is perfect for your open-source project on GitHub, as an alternative to expensive databases like Geochron.

## Objectives
- Collect free and natural ideas on improvements.
- See what users like or criticize.
- Find new features without organized effort.

## Simple Methodology
- **Where**: Open a thread on GitHub Discussions or Issues in your repo (e.g., "Share ideas to improve the converter!").
- **How**: Post inviting spontaneous feedback, without questionnaires.
- **Target**: Students, GIS developers, anyone interested in free maps.
- **Time**: Leave open for 1-2 weeks, check comments.

## Examples of Imagined Suggestions (Based on Possible Feedback)
- **User 1**: "Great for students! Add support for more image formats, like high-resolution PNG."
- **User 2**: "I tried with an Italy map, but AI messes up borders. Improve accuracy?"
- **User 3**: "Why not a web interface? It would be easier to use without installing Python."
- **Common Themes**: Simplicity, accuracy, free access.

## Advantages for the Project
- Low cost: Just time to write the post.
- Spontaneous: Genuine ideas, not forced.
- Community: Build a small community on GitHub.

## Disadvantages and How to Handle Them
- Few comments: If no one responds, share on Reddit (r/gis or r/learnprogramming).
- Episodic: Not always reliable, but good for quick ideas.

## Conclusions
Open a discussion on GitHub today! This method is ideal for students, collecting natural feedback. Integrate with competition analysis for better ideas.
