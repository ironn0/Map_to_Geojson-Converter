# Competition Analysis and Best Practices for Map to GeoJSON Converter 

## Introduction
The Map to GeoJSON Converter project was born from the need to create free GeoJSON files from images, as an alternative to expensive databases from sites like Geochron (500€). The competition analysis is limited to online research to improve the tool.

## Analysis Objectives
- Find similar free tools online.
- See what works well and what doesn't.
- Take ideas to make the converter better and accessible.

## Simple Methodology
- Search on Google for "free image to geojson converter" or "open source map converter".
- Read reviews on sites like Reddit, GitHub, or GIS forums.
- Compare with tools I know (e.g., free QGIS).

## Identified Competing Products (Free/Open-Source)

### 1. **QGIS**
   - **Description**: Free GIS software, with plugins to convert to GeoJSON.
   - **Strengths**: Free, powerful for geographic data.
   - **Weaknesses**: Complex to learn.
   - **Why useful**: Shows how to handle accurate conversions without costs.

### 2. **GDAL (with Python)**
   - **Description**: Free library to manipulate geographic data, used in your scripts.
   - **Strengths**: Precise, integrable with Python.
   - **Weaknesses**: Requires code, no graphical interface.
   - **Why useful**: Already in your project, confirms it's a good base.

### 3. **Free Online Tools (e.g., MyGeodata)**
   - **Description**: Websites to convert files for free.
   - **Strengths**: Easy to use, no installation.
   - **Weaknesses**: Limits on large files, privacy (online upload).
   - **Why useful**: Ideas for a simple web interface in your tool.

### 4. **GitHub Repos (e.g., image-to-geojson)**
   - **Description**: Open-source projects on GitHub for similar conversions.
   - **Strengths**: Free code to study.
   - **Weaknesses**: Might be incomplete.
   - **Why useful**: Copy ideas or improve your code.

## Simplified Best Practices
- **Free and Open-Source**: Like QGIS, make the tool accessible.
- **Easy to Use**: Add an easy interface, inspired by online tools.
- **Use Known Libraries**: Continue with GDAL/Python for reliability.
- **Share on GitHub**: For feedback from other students.

## Recommendations for the Project
- Study open-source code on GitHub for ideas.
- Test competing tools and note what's missing (e.g., AI support for images).
- Position the tool as a free alternative to expensive databases.
